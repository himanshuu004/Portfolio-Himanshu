## 📝 Current Status:

✅ Contact form is built and ready  
⚠️ Waiting for your EmailJS or Formspree credentials  
✅ Form will work once you add credentials  
✅ Site is running at http://localhost:5173  

## 🎬 After Setup:

Once you add your credentials and save the file:
1. The form will send emails directly to your inbox
2. No mail client will open
3. You'll see "Message Sent!" confirmation
4. You'll receive emails at himanshuu004@gmail.com within seconds

## 💡 Which to Choose?

- **Choose EmailJS** if you want more control, custom templates, and up to 200 emails/month
- **Choose Formspree** if you want the absolute easiest setup (literally 2 minutes)

Both work perfectly! I recommend **Formspree** if you want it working in 2 minutes, or **EmailJS** if you want more features.
